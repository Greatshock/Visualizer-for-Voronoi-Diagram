</p><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This page briefly describes what a Voronoi diagram is and provides an
interactive demonstration of how these can be created using <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/sjf/">Fortune's</a> plain-sweep algorithm.

</p><p>The goal of the page is to give you an <strong>intuitive</strong>
understanding of how Fortune's algorithm works and how Voronoi diagrams look, so
if you have  never heard of these diagrams we suggest that you follow some of
the links given to get a better understanding of the theoretical aspects of
Voronoi diagrams.

</p><p>A starting point might be <a href="http://www.voronoi.com/IndexNoframes.htm">Voronoi.com</a>, which features a
lot of Voronoi related stuff.

</p><p>The applet located on this page was created in context with the course &quot;Computational
Geometry&quot; held by <a href="http://www.diku.dk/~pawel/">Pawel Winter</a>
during the spring of 2000 at the department of computer science at the
university of Copenhagen (<a href="http://www.diku.dk/">DIKU</a>).

<!-- ================================= -->
</p><h2>What is a Voronoi diagram?</h2>

<p><img src="VoronoiDiagram.GIF" width="206" height="108" border="2" align="Right" alt="Example of a Voronoi diagram" />Imagine you have a map over a city with
<em>n</em> cell phone masts. A cell phone always connects to the closest mast,
so you'd like to split up the city in zones, where each zone has exactly one
cell phone mast and each location inside such a zone is closest to the cell
phone mast found in the same zone.

</p><p>The result of such a partitioning is often referred to as a Voronoi diagram
and can be created in <em>O(n log n)</em> time by various algorithms. This is
also a lower limit.

<!-- ================================= -->
</p><h2>Using a Voronoi diagram</h2>

<p>In the above example we have transformed the problem of finding the closest
mast to the problem of finding the zone in which we are located (also known as
the point location problem). This can be determined in logarithmic time instead
of the linear time, which would be required for finding the nearest mast if no
preprocessing was done. Naturally you'll need to query the Voronoi diagram more
than once to make up for this preprocessing time.

</p><p>Though given a Voronoi diagram we can solve a lot of other geometrical
problems such as convex hull and Delaunay triangulation.

<!-- ================================= -->
</p><h2>Implementation details</h2>

<p>Our implementation is based on the explanation given in the book entitled
<a href="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/geobook/">Computational Geometry: Algorithms and
Applications.</a>

</p><p>An online explanation of the details in Fortune's algorithm is carefully
described by <a href="http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/studentwork/CESCG99/RCuk/">Èuk
Roman</a> and can be found at his page.

</p><p>It should be emphasized that our implementation does not run in <em>O(n log
n)</em>. We only wanted to visualize the algorithm and all structures have been
made as simple as possible to avoid unneccessary complexity. A non-visual
implementation, done in C, can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/implement/fortune/implement.shtml">this</a>
page.

</p><h2>The source</h2>

<p>The source is available at <a href="http://github.com/sorbits/visual-fortune-algorithm/tree/master">GitHub</a>. Unfortunately we managed to delete the source, but thanks to <a href="http://www.varaneckas.com/jad">Jad</a> (a
JAVA decompiler) we were able to get it back, but all comments and local
variable names were lost. Furthermore this has resulted in a not 100% strict
coding style, since most of it was produced by Jad. This is also our first
program made in Java.

<h3>How to use it</h3>

<p>You control the program with your mouse. At any time you can click on the
right side of the sweep-line to add a point. Below follows an explanation of
the various buttons and checkboxes.

</dt><dd>Continue the incremental movement.
</dd><dt><b>Next event</b>
</dt><dd>Move the sweep-line to the next event point, including circle event points.
</dd><dt><b>Next pixel</b>
</dt><dd>Move sweep-line a single pixel.

<h3>Interesting point configurations</h3>

<p>If you draw a perfect circle of points all the zones should meet in the
center of this circle. Now try to spoil this feature by adding a point in the
middle of the circle. Even if you didn't succeed in making the circle
<b>perfect</b> then try it anyway.
